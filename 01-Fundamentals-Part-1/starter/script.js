let firstName = "Bhupender"; // giving camelCase naming is a good practice
let lastName = "Mehta";

console.log(firstName); //giving semicolons after every line is a good coding practice

let first_name = "Bhupender"; //this type of naming conventions is very popular in ruby

//you should not use reserved keywords like new and functions it will throw errors

// your naming convention should be descriptive and jisse humein pta chal jaaye ki hum kiski baat karahe h it will help in writing cleaner code
